    "text": "Chemistry Powering your Smartphone\n\nWhen I waltzed off to high school with my new Nokia phone, I thought I just had the new, coolest replacement for my old pink princess walkie-talkie. Except now, my friends and I could text or talk to each other wherever we were, instead of pretending, when we were running around each other's backyards. Now, I'll be honest. Back then, I didn't think a lot about how these devices were made. They tended to show up on Christmas morning, so maybe they were made by the elves in Santa's workshop. \n\nLet me ask you a question. Who do you think the real elves that make these devices are? If I ask a lot of the people I know, they would say it's the hoodie-wearing software engineers in Silicon Valley, hacking away at code. But a lot has to happen to these devices before they're ready for any kind of code. These devices start at the atomic level. So if you ask me, the real elves are the chemists. That's right, I said the chemists. Chemistry is the hero of electronic communications. And my goal today is to convince you to agree with me. \n\nOK, let's start simple, and take a look inside these insanely addictive devices. Because without chemistry, what is an information superhighway that we love, would just be a really expensive, shiny paperweight. Chemistry enables all of these layers. Let's start at the display. How do you think we get those bright, vivid colors that we love so much? Well, I'll tell you. There's organic polymers embedded within the display, that can take electricity and turn it into the blue, red and green that we enjoy in our pictures. \n\nWhat if we move down to the battery? Now there's some intense research. How do we take the chemical principles of traditional batteries and pair it with new, high surface area electrodes, so we can pack more charge in a smaller footprint of space, so that we could power our devices all day long, while we're taking selfies, without having to recharge our batteries or sit tethered to an electrical outlet? \n\nWhat if we go to the adhesives that bind it all together, so that it could withstand our frequent usage? After all, as a millennial, I have to take my phone out at least 200 times a day to check it, and in the process, drop it two to three times. \n\nBut what are the real brains of these devices? What makes them work the way that we love them so much? Well that all has to do with electrical components and circuitry that are tethered to a printed circuit board. Or maybe you prefer a biological metaphor -- the motherboard, you might have heard of that. Now, the printed circuit board doesn't really get talked about a lot. And I'll be honest, I don't know why that is. Maybe it's because it's the least sexy layer and it's hidden beneath all of those other sleek-looking layers. But it's time to finally give this Clark Kent layer the Superman-worthy praise it deserves. \n\nAnd so I ask you a question. What do you think a printed circuit board is? Well, consider a metaphor. Think about the city that you live in. You have all these points of interest that you want to get to: your home, your work, restaurants, a couple of Starbucks on every block. And so we build roads that connect them all together. That's what a printed circuit board is. Except, instead of having things like restaurants, we have transistors on chips, capacitors, resistors, all of these electrical components that need to find a way to talk to each other. And so what are our roads? Well, we build tiny copper wires. \n\nSo the next question is, how do we make these tiny copper wires? They're really small. Could it be that we go to the hardware store, pick up a spool of copper wire, get some wire cutters, a little clip-clip, saw it all up and then, bam -- we have our printed circuit board? No way. These wires are way too small for that. And so we have to rely on our friend: chemistry. \n\nNow, the chemical process to make these tiny copper wires is seemingly simple. We start with a solution of positively charged copper spheres. We then add to it an insulating printed circuit board. And we feed those positively charged spheres negatively charged electrons by adding formaldehyde to the mix. So you might remember formaldehyde. Really distinct odor, used to preserve frogs in biology class. Well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that. And it's a really key component to making these tiny copper wires. You see, the electrons on formaldehyde have a drive. They want to jump over to those positively charged copper spheres. And that's all because of a process known as redox chemistry. And when that happens, we can take these positively charged copper spheres and turn them into bright, shiny, metallic and conductive copper. And once we have conductive copper, now we're cooking with gas. And we can get all of those electrical components to talk to each other. So thank you once again to chemistry. \n\nAnd let's take a thought and think about how far we've come with chemistry. Clearly, in electronic communications, size matters. So let's think about how we can shrink down our devices, so that we can go from our 1990s Zack Morris cell phone to something a little bit more sleek, like the phones of today that can fit in our pockets. Although, let's be real here: absolutely nothing can fit into ladies' pants pockets, if you can find a pair of pants that has pockets. \n\n\nAnd I don't think chemistry can help us with that problem. But more important than shrinking the actual device, how do we shrink the circuitry inside of it, and shrink it by 100 times, so that we can take the circuitry from the micron scale all the way down to the nanometer scale? Because, let's face it, right now we all want more powerful and faster phones. Well, more power and faster requires more circuitry. \n\nSo how do we do this? It's not like we have some magic electromagnetic shrink ray, like professor Wayne Szalinski used in \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" to shrink his children. On accident, of course. Or do we? Well, actually, in the field, there's a process that's pretty similar to that. And it's name is photolithography. In photolithography, we take electromagnetic radiation, or what we tend to call light, and we use it to shrink down some of that circuitry, so that we could cram more of it into a really small space. \n\nNow, how does this work? Well, we start with a substrate that has a light-sensitive film on it. We then cover it with a mask that has a pattern on top of it of fine lines and features that are going to make the phone work the way that we want it to. We then expose a bright light and shine it through this mask, which creates a shadow of that pattern on the surface. Now, anywhere that the light can get through the mask, it's going to cause a chemical reaction to occur. And that's going to burn the image of that pattern into the substrate. \n\nSo the question you're probably asking is, how do we go from a burned image to clean fine lines and features? And for that, we have to use a chemical solution called the developer. Now the developer is special. What it can do is take all of the nonexposed areas and remove them selectively, leaving behind clean fine lines and features, and making our miniaturized devices work. \n\nSo, we've used chemistry now to build up our devices, and we've used it to shrink down our devices. So I've probably convinced you that chemistry is the true hero, and we could wrap it up there. \n\nHold on, we're not done. Not so fast. Because we're all human. And as a human, I always want more. And so now I want to think about how to use chemistry to extract more out of a device. \n\nRight now, we're being told that we want something called 5G, or the promised fifth generation of wireless. Now, you might have heard of 5G in commercials that are starting to appear. Or maybe some of you even experienced it in the 2018 winter Olympics. What I'm most excited about for 5G is that, when I'm late, running out of the house to catch a plane, I can download movies onto my device in 40 seconds as opposed to 40 minutes. But once true 5G is here, it's going to be a lot more than how many movies we can put on our device. \n\nSo the question is, why is true 5G not here? And I'll let you in on a little secret. It's pretty easy to answer. It's just plain hard to do. You see, if you use those traditional materials and copper to build 5G devices, the signal can't make it to its final destination. \n\nTraditionally, we use really rough insulating layers to support copper wires. Think about Velcro fasteners. It's the roughness of the two pieces that make them stick together. That's pretty important if you want to have a device that's going to last longer than it takes you to rip it out of the box and start installing all of your apps on it. \n\nBut this roughness causes a problem. You see, at the high speeds for 5G the signal has to travel close to that roughness. And it makes it get lost before it reaches its final destination. Think about a mountain range. And you have a complex system of roads that goes up and over it, and you're trying to get to the other side. Don't you agree with me that it would probably take a really long time, and you would probably get lost, if you had to go up and down all of the mountains, as opposed to if you just drilled a flat tunnel that could go straight on through? Well it's the same thing in our 5G devices. If we could remove this roughness, then we can send the 5G signal straight on through uninterrupted. Sounds pretty good, right? \n\nBut hold on. Didn't I just tell you that we needed that roughness to keep the device together? And if we remove it, we're in a situation where now the copper isn't going to stick to that underlying substrate. Think about building a house of Lego blocks, with all of the nooks and crannies that latch together, as opposed to smooth building blocks. Which of the two is going to have more structural integrity when the two-year-old comes ripping through the living room, trying to play Godzilla and knock everything down? But what if we put glue on those smooth blocks? And that's what the industry is waiting for. They're waiting for the chemists to design new, smooth surfaces with increased inherent adhesion for some of those copper wires. \n\nAnd when we solve this problem, and we will solve the problem, and we'll work with physicists and engineers to solve all of the challenges of 5G, well then the number of applications is going to skyrocket. So yeah, we'll have things like self-driving cars, because now our data networks can handle the speeds and the amount of information required to make that work. But let's start to use imagination. I can imagine going into a restaurant with a friend that has a peanut allergy, taking out my phone, waving it over the food and having the food tell us a really important answer to a question -- deadly or safe to consume? Or maybe our devices will get so good at processing information about us, that they'll become like our personal trainers. And they'll know the most efficient way for us to burn calories. I know come November, when I'm trying to burn off some of these pregnancy pounds, I would love a device that could tell me how to do that. \n\nI really don't know another way of saying it, except chemistry is just cool. And it enables all of these electronic devices. So the next time you send a text or take a selfie, think about all those atoms that are hard at work and the innovation that came before them. Who knows, maybe even some of you listening to this talk, perhaps even on your mobile device, will decide that you too want to play sidekick to Captain Chemistry, the true hero of electronic devices. \n\nThank you for your attention, and thank you chemistry.\n\n"

    "text": "It was a Sunday afternoon back in April of this year. My phone was ringing, I picked it up. The voice said, \"It's Rebecca. I'm just calling to invite you to my funeral.\" I said, \"Rebecca, what are you talking about?\" She said, \"Joy, as my friend, you have to let me go. It's my time.\" The next day, she was dead. \n\nRebecca was 31 years old when she died. She had an eight-year struggle with breast cancer. It came back three times. I failed her. The scientific community failed her. And the medical community failed her. And she's not the only one. Every five seconds, someone dies of cancer. Today, we medical researchers are committed to having Rebecca and people like her be one of the last patients that we fail. \n\nThe US government alone has spent over 100 billion on cancer research since the 1970s, with limited progress in regards to patient survival, especially for certain types of very aggressive cancers. So we need a change because, clearly, what we've been doing so far has not been working. \n\nAnd what we do in medicine is to send out firefighters, because cancer is like a big fire. And these firefighters are the cancer drugs. But we're sending them out without a fire truck -- so without transportation, without ladders and without emergency equipment. And over 99 percent of these firefighters never make it to the fire. Over 99 percent of cancer drugs never make it to the tumor because they lack transportation and tools to take them to the location they're aiming for. Turns out, it really is all about location, location, location. \n\nSo we need a fire truck to get to the right location. And I'm here to tell you that nanoparticles are the fire trucks. We can load cancer drugs inside nanoparticles, and nanoparticles can function as the carrier and necessary equipment to bring the cancer drugs to the heart of the tumor. \n\nSo what are nanoparticles, and what does it really mean to be nano-sized? Well, there are many different types of nanoparticles made out of various materials, such as metal-based nanoparticles or fat-based nanoparticles. But to really illustrate what it means to be nano-sized, I took one of my hair strands and placed it under the microscope. Now, I have very thin hair, so my hair is approximately 40,000 nanometers in diameter. So this means, if we take 400 of our nanoparticles and we stack them on top of each other, we get the thickness of a single hair strand. \n\n\n03:43\nI lead a nanoparticle laboratory to fight cancer and other diseases at Mayo Clinic here in Jacksonville. And at Mayo Clinic, we really have the tools to make a difference for patients, thanks to the generous donations and grants to fund our research. And so, how do these nanoparticles manage to transport cancer drugs to the tumor? Well, they have an extensive toolbox. \n\n\n04:13\nCancer drugs without nanoparticles are quickly washed out of the body through the kidneys because they're so small. So it's like water going through a sieve. And so they don't really have time to reach the tumor. Here we see an illustration of this. We have the firefighters, the cancer drugs. They're circulating in the blood, but they're quickly washed out of the body and they don't really end up inside the tumor. But if we put these cancer drugs inside nanoparticles, they will not get washed out by the body because the nanoparticles are too big. And they will continue to circulate in the blood, giving them more time to find the tumor. And here we see the cancer drug, the firefighters, inside the fire truck, the nanoparticles. They're circulating in the blood, they don't get washed out and they actually end up reaching the tumor. \n\n\n05:11\nAnd so what other tools do nanoparticles have? Well, they can protect cancer drugs from getting destroyed inside the body. There are certain very important but sensitive drugs that are easily degraded by enzymes in the blood. So unless they have this nanoparticle protection, they will not be able to function. Another nanoparticle tool are these surface extensions that are like tiny hands with fingers that grab on to the tumor and fit exactly onto it, so that when the nanoparticles are circulating, they can attach onto the cancer cells, buying the cancer drugs more time to do their job. And these are just some of the many tools that nanoparticles can have. \n\n\n05:58\nAnd today, we have more than 10 clinically approved nanoparticles for cancer that are given to patients all over the world. Yet, we have patients, like Rebecca, who die. So what are the major challenges and limitations with currently approved nanoparticles? Well, a major challenge is the liver, because the liver is the body's filtration system, and the liver recognizes and destroys foreign objects, such as viruses, bacteria and also nanoparticles. And the immune cells in the liver eat the nanoparticles, preventing them from reaching the tumor. And here we see an illustration where the kidney is no longer a problem, but these fire trucks, the nanoparticles, get stuck in the liver and, actually, less of them end up reaching the tumor. \n\n\n06:59\nSo a future strategy to improve nanoparticles is to temporarily disarm the immune cells in the liver. So how do we disarm these cells? Well, we looked at drugs that were already clinically approved for other indications to see if any of them could stop the immune cells from eating the nanoparticles. And unexpectedly, in one of our preclinical studies, we found that a 70-year-old malaria drug was able to stop the immune cells from internalizing the nanoparticles so that they could escape the liver and continue their journey to their goal, the tumor. And here we see the illustration of blocking the liver. The nanoparticles don't go there, and they instead end up in the tumor. So, sometimes, unexpected connections are made in science that lead to new solutions. \n\n\n07:59\nAnother strategy for preventing nanoparticles from getting stuck in the liver is to use the body's own nanoparticles. Yes -- surprise, surprise. You, and you and you, and all of us have a lot of nanoparticles circulating in our bodies. And because they're part of our bodies, the liver is less likely to label them as foreign. And these biological nanoparticles can be found in the saliva, in the blood, in the urine, in pancreatic juice. And we can collect them from the body and use them as fire trucks for cancer drugs. And in this case, the immune cells in the liver are less likely to eat the biological nanoparticles. So we're using a Trojan-horse-based concept to fool the liver. And here we see the biological nanoparticles circulating in the blood. They don't get recognized by the liver, and they end up in the tumor. And in the future, we want to exploit nature's own nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery, to reduce side effects and save lives by preventing the cancer drugs from being in the wrong location. \n\n\n09:19\nHowever, a major problem has been: How do we isolate these biological nanoparticles in large quantities without damaging them? My lab has developed an efficient method for doing this. We can process large quantities of liquids from the body to produce a highly concentrated, high-quality formulation of biological nanoparticles. And these nanoparticles are not yet in clinical use, because it takes an average of 12 years to get something from the lab to your medicine cabinet. \n\n\n10:00\nAnd this is the type of challenge that requires teamwork from scientists and physicians, who dedicate their lives to this battle. And we keep going, thanks to inspiration from patients. And I believe that if we keep working on these nanomedicines, we will be able to reduce harm to healthy organs, improve quality of life and save future patients. \n\n\n10:32\nI like to imagine that if these treatments had been available for Rebecca, that call from her could have been an invitation not to her funeral, but her wedding.\n\n"

    "text": "Danger of AI\n\nSo, artificial intelligence is known for disrupting all kinds of industries. What about ice cream? What kind of mind-blowing new flavors could we generate with the power of an advanced artificial intelligence? So I teamed up with a group of coders from Kealing Middle School to find out the answer to this question. They collected over 1,600 existing ice cream flavors, and together, we fed them to an algorithm to see what it would generate. And here are some of the flavors that the AI came up with. \n\nThese flavors are not delicious, as we might have hoped they would be. So the question is: What happened? What went wrong? Is the AI trying to kill us? Or is it trying to do what we asked, and there was a problem? \n\nIn movies, when something goes wrong with AI, it's usually because the AI has decided that it doesn't want to obey the humans anymore, and it's got its own goals, thank you very much. In real life, though, the AI that we actually have is not nearly smart enough for that. It has the approximate computing power of an earthworm, or maybe at most a single honeybee, and actually, probably maybe less. Like, we're constantly learning new things about brains that make it clear how much our AIs don't measure up to real brains. So today's AI can do a task like identify a pedestrian in a picture, but it doesn't have a concept of what the pedestrian is beyond that it's a collection of lines and textures and things. It doesn't know what a human actually is. So will today's AI do what we ask it to do? It will if it can, but it might not do what we actually want. \n\nSo let's say that you were trying to get an AI to take this collection of robot parts and assemble them into some kind of robot to get from Point A to Point B. Now, if you were going to try and solve this problem by writing a traditional-style computer program, you would give the program step-by-step instructions on how to take these parts, how to assemble them into a robot with legs and then how to use those legs to walk to Point B. But when you're using AI to solve the problem, it goes differently. You don't tell it how to solve the problem, you just give it the goal, and it has to figure out for itself via trial and error how to reach that goal. And it turns out that the way AI tends to solve this particular problem is by doing this: it assembles itself into a tower and then falls over and lands at Point B. And technically, this solves the problem. Technically, it got to Point B. The danger of AI is not that it's going to rebel against us, it's that it's going to do exactly what we ask it to do. So then the trick of working with AI becomes: How do we set up the problem so that it actually does what we want? \n\nSo this little robot here is being controlled by an AI. The AI came up with a design for the robot legs and then figured out how to use them to get past all these obstacles. But when David Ha set up this experiment, he had to set it up with very, very strict limits on how big the AI was allowed to make the legs, because otherwise ... \n\nAnd technically, it got to the end of that obstacle course. So you see how hard it is to get AI to do something as simple as just walk. \n\nSo seeing the AI do this, you may say, OK, no fair, you can't just be a tall tower and fall over, you have to actually, like, use legs to walk. And it turns out, that doesn't always work, either. This AI's job was to move fast. They didn't tell it that it had to run facing forward or that it couldn't use its arms. So this is what you get when you train AI to move fast, you get things like somersaulting and silly walks. It's really common. So is twitching along the floor in a heap. \n\nSo in my opinion, you know what should have been a whole lot weirder is the \"Terminator\" robots. Hacking \"The Matrix\" is another thing that AI will do if you give it a chance. So if you train an AI in a simulation, it will learn how to do things like hack into the simulation's math errors and harvest them for energy. Or it will figure out how to move faster by glitching repeatedly into the floor. When you're working with AI, it's less like working with another human and a lot more like working with some kind of weird force of nature. And it's really easy to accidentally give AI the wrong problem to solve, and often we don't realize that until something has actually gone wrong. \n\nSo here's an experiment I did, where I wanted the AI to copy paint colors, to invent new paint colors, given the list like the ones here on the left. And here's what the AI actually came up with. \n\nSo technically, it did what I asked it to. I thought I was asking it for, like, nice paint color names, but what I was actually asking it to do was just imitate the kinds of letter combinations that it had seen in the original. And I didn't tell it anything about what words mean, or that there are maybe some words that it should avoid using in these paint colors. So its entire world is the data that I gave it. Like with the ice cream flavors, it doesn't know about anything else. \n\nSo it is through the data that we often accidentally tell AI to do the wrong thing. This is a fish called a tench. And there was a group of researchers who trained an AI to identify this tench in pictures. But then when they asked it what part of the picture it was actually using to identify the fish, here's what it highlighted. Yes, those are human fingers. Why would it be looking for human fingers if it's trying to identify a fish? Well, it turns out that the tench is a trophy fish, and so in a lot of pictures that the AI had seen of this fish during training, the fish looked like this. \n\nAnd it didn't know that the fingers aren't part of the fish. \n\nSo you see why it is so hard to design an AI that actually can understand what it's looking at. And this is why designing the image recognition in self-driving cars is so hard, and why so many self-driving car failures are because the AI got confused. I want to talk about an example from 2016. There was a fatal accident when somebody was using Tesla's autopilot AI, but instead of using it on the highway like it was designed for, they used it on city streets. And what happened was, a truck drove out in front of the car and the car failed to brake. Now, the AI definitely was trained to recognize trucks in pictures. But what it looks like happened is the AI was trained to recognize trucks on highway driving, where you would expect to see trucks from behind. Trucks on the side is not supposed to happen on a highway, and so when the AI saw this truck, it looks like the AI recognized it as most likely to be a road sign and therefore, safe to drive underneath. \n\nHere's an AI misstep from a different field. Amazon recently had to give up on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-sorting algorithm that they were working on when they discovered that the algorithm had learned to discriminate against women. What happened is they had trained it on example r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of people who they had hired in the past. And from these examples, the AI learned to avoid the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of people who had gone to women's colleges or who had the word \"women\" somewhere in their resume, as in, \"women's soccer team\" or \"Society of Women Engineers.\" The AI didn't know that it wasn't supposed to copy this particular thing that it had seen the humans do. And technically, it did what they asked it to do. They just accidentally asked it to do the wrong thing. \n\nAnd this happens all the time with AI. AI can be really destructive and not know it. So the AIs that recommend new content in Facebook, in YouTube, they're optimized to increase the number of clicks and views. And unfortunately, one way that they have found of doing this is to recommend the content of conspiracy theories or bigotry. The AIs themselves don't have any concept of what this content actually is, and they don't have any concept of what the consequences might be of recommending this content. \n\nSo, when we're working with AI, it's up to us to avoid problems. And avoiding things going wrong, that may come down to the age-old problem of communication, where we as humans have to learn how to communicate with AI. We have to learn what AI is capable of doing and what it's not, and to understand that, with its tiny little worm brain, AI doesn't really understand what we're trying to ask it to do. So in other words, we have to be prepared to work with AI that's not the super-competent, all-knowing AI of science fiction. We have to prepared to work with an AI that's the one that we actually have in the present day. And present-day AI is plenty weird enough.\n\n"

    "text": "Will Quantum Computers Defeat Cryptographers\n\nI'm in the business of safeguarding secrets, and this includes your secrets. \n\nCryptographers are the first line of defense in an ongoing war that's been raging for centuries: a war between code makers and code breakers. And this is a war on information. The modern battlefield for information is digital. And it wages across your phones, your computers and the internet. Our job is to create systems that scramble your emails and credit card numbers, your phone calls and text messages -- and that includes those saucy selfies -- \n\nso that all of this information can only be descrambled by the recipient that it's intended for. \n\nNow, until very recently, we thought we'd won this war for good. Right now, each of your smartphones is using encryption that we thought was unbreakable and that was going to remain that way. We were wrong, because quantum computers are coming, and they're going to change the game completely. \n\nThroughout history, cryptography and code-breaking has always been this game of cat and mouse. Back in the 1500s, Queen Mary of the Scots thought she was sending encrypted letters that only her soldiers could decipher. But Queen Elizabeth of England, she had code breakers that were all over it. They decrypted Mary's letters, saw that she was attempting to assassinate Elizabeth and, subsequently, they chopped Mary's head off. A few centuries later, in World War II, the Nazis communicated using the Engima code, a much more complicated encryption scheme that they thought was unbreakable. But then good old Alan Turing, the same guy who invented what we now call the modern computer, he built a machine and used it to break Enigma. He deciphered the German messages and helped to bring Hitler and his Third Reich to a halt. And so the story has gone throughout the centuries. Cryptographers improve their encryption, and then code breakers fight back and they find a way to break it. This war's gone back and forth, and it's been pretty neck and neck. \n\nThat was until the 1970s, when some cryptographers made a huge breakthrough. They discovered an extremely powerful way to do encryption called \"public-key cryptography.\" Unlike all of the prior methods used throughout history, it doesn't require that the two parties that want to send each other confidential information have exchanged the secret key beforehand. The magic of public-key cryptography is that it allows us to connect securely with anyone in the world, whether we've exchanged data before or not, and to do it so fast that you and I don't even realize it's happening. Whether you're texting your mate to catch up for a beer, or you're a bank that's transferring billions of dollars to another bank, modern encryption enables us to send data that can be secured in a matter of milliseconds. \n\nThe brilliant idea that makes this magic possible, it relies on hard mathematical problems. Cryptographers are deeply interested in things that calculators can't do. For example, calculators can multiply any two numbers you like, no matter how big the size. But going back the other way -- starting with the product and then asking, \"Which two numbers multiply to give this one?\" -- that's actually a really hard problem. If I asked you to find which two-digit numbers multiply to give 851, even with a calculator, most people in this room would have a hard time finding the answer by the time I'm finished with this talk. And if I make the numbers a little larger, then there's no calculator on earth that can do this. In fact, even the world's fastest supercomputer would take longer than the life age of the universe to find the two numbers that multiply to give this one. And this problem, called \"integer factorization,\" is exactly what each of your smartphones and laptops is using right now to keep your data secure. This is the basis of modern encryption. And the fact that all the computing power on the planet combined can't solve it, that's the reason we cryptographers thought we'd found a way to stay ahead of the code breakers for good. \n\nPerhaps we got a little cocky because just when we thought the war was won, a bunch of 20th-century physicists came to the party, and they revealed that the laws of the universe, the same laws that modern cryptography was built upon, they aren't as we thought they were. We thought that one object couldn't be in two places at the same time. It's not the case. We thought nothing can possibly spin clockwise and anticlockwise simultaneously. But that's incorrect. And we thought that two objects on opposite sides of the universe, light years away from each other, they can't possibly influence one another instantaneously. We were wrong again. \n\nAnd isn't that always the way life seems to go? Just when you think you've got everything covered, your ducks in a row, a bunch of physicists come along and reveal that the fundamental laws of the universe are completely different to what you thought? \n\n\nAnd it screws everything up. \n\nSee, in the teeny tiny subatomic realm, at the level of electrons and protons, the classical laws of physics, the ones that we all know and love, they go out the window. And it's here that the laws of quantum mechanics kick in. In quantum mechanics, an electron can be spinning clockwise and anticlockwise at the same time, and a proton can be in two places at once. It sounds like science fiction, but that's only because the crazy quantum nature of our universe, it hides itself from us. And it stayed hidden from us until the 20th century. But now that we've seen it, the whole world is in an arms race to try to build a quantum computer -- a computer that can harness the power of this weird and wacky quantum behavior. \n\nThese things are so revolutionary and so powerful that they'll make today's fastest supercomputer look useless in comparison. In fact, for certain problems that are of great interest to us, today's fastest supercomputer is closer to an abacus than to a quantum computer. That's right, I'm talking about those little wooden things with the beads. Quantum computers can simulate chemical and biological processes that are far beyond the reach of our classical computers. And as such, they promise to help us solve some of our planet's biggest problems. They're going to help us combat global hunger; to tackle climate change; to find cures for diseases and pandemics for which we've so far been unsuccessful; to create superhuman artificial intelligence; and perhaps even more important than all of those things, they're going to help us understand the very nature of our universe. \n\nBut with this incredible potential comes an incredible risk. Remember those big numbers I talked about earlier? I'm not talking about 851. In fact, if anyone in here has been distracted trying to find those factors, I'm going to put you out of your misery and tell you that it's 23 times 37. \n\nI'm talking about the much bigger number that followed it. While today's fastest supercomputer couldn't find those factors in the life age of the universe, a quantum computer could easily factorize numbers way, way bigger than that one. \n\nQuantum computers will break all of the encryption currently used to protect you and I from hackers. And they'll do it easily. Let me put it this way: if quantum computing was a spear, then modern encryption, the same unbreakable system that's protected us for decades, it would be like a shield made of tissue paper. Anyone with access to a quantum computer will have the master key to unlock anything they like in our digital world. They could steal money from banks and control economies. They could power off hospitals or launch nukes. Or they could just sit back and watch all of us on our webcams without any of us knowing that this is happening. \n\nNow, the fundamental unit of information on all of the computers we're used to, like this one, it's called a \"bit.\" A single bit can be one of two states: it can be a zero or it can be a one. When I FaceTime my mum from the other side of the world -- and she's going to kill me for having this slide -- \n\n\nwe're actually just sending each other long sequences of zeroes and ones that bounce from computer to computer, from satellite to satellite, transmitting our data at a rapid pace. Bits are certainly very useful. In fact, anything we currently do with technology is indebted to the usefulness of bits. But we're starting to realize that bits are really poor at simulating complex molecules and particles. And this is because, in some sense, subatomic processes can be doing two or more opposing things at the same time as they follow these bizarre rules of quantum mechanics. \n\nSo, late last century, some really brainy physicists had this ingenious idea: to instead build computers that are founded on the principles of quantum mechanics. Now, the fundamental unit of information of a quantum computer, it's called a \"qubit.\" It stands for \"quantum bit.\" Instead of having just two states, like zero or one, a qubit can be an infinite number of states. And this corresponds to it being some combination of both zero and one at the same time, a phenomenon that we call \"superposition.\" And when we have two qubits in superposition, we're actually working across all four combinations of zero-zero, zero-one, one-zero and one-one. With three qubits, we're working in superposition across eight combinations, and so on. Each time we add a single qubit, we double the number of combinations that we can work with in superposition at the same time. And so when we scale up to work with many qubits, we can work with an exponential number of combinations at the same time. And this just hints at where the power of quantum computing is coming from. \n\nNow, in modern encryption, our secret keys, like the two factors of that larger number, they're just long sequences of zeroes and ones. To find them, a classical computer must go through every single combination, one after the other, until it finds the one that works and breaks our encryption. But on a quantum computer, with enough qubits in superposition, information can be extracted from all combinations at the same time. In very few steps, a quantum computer can brush aside all of the incorrect combinations, home in on the correct one and then unlock our treasured secrets. \n\nNow, at the crazy quantum level, something truly incredible is happening here. The conventional wisdom held by many leading physicists -- and you've got to stay with me on this one -- is that each combination is actually examined by its very own quantum computer inside its very own parallel universe. Each of these combinations, they add up like waves in a pool of water. The combinations that are wrong, they cancel each other out. And the combinations that are right, they reinforce and amplify each other. So at the end of the quantum computing program, all that's left is the correct answer, that we can then observe here in this universe. \n\nNow, if that doesn't make complete sense to you, don't stress. \n\nYou're in good company. Niels Bohr, one of the pioneers of this field, he once said that anyone who could contemplate quantum mechanics without being profoundly shocked, they haven't understood it. \n\nBut you get an idea of what we're up against, and why it's now up to us cryptographers to really step it up. And we have to do it fast, because quantum computers, they already exist in labs all over the world. \n\nFortunately, at this minute, they only exist at a relatively small scale, still too small to break our much larger cryptographic keys. But we might not be safe for long. Some folks believe that secret government agencies have already built a big enough one, and they just haven't told anyone yet. Some pundits say they're more like 10 years off. Some people say it's more like 30. You might think that if quantum computers are 10 years away, surely that's enough time for us cryptographers to figure it out and to secure the internet in time. \n\nBut unfortunately, it's not that easy. Even if we ignore the many years that it takes to standardize and deploy and then roll out new encryption technology, in some ways we may already be too late. Smart digital criminals and government agencies may already be storing our most sensitive encrypted data in anticipation for the quantum future ahead. The messages of foreign leaders, of war generals or of individuals who question power, they're encrypted for now. But as soon as the day comes that someone gets their hands on a quantum computer, they can retroactively break anything from the past. In certain government and financial sectors or in military organizations, sensitive data has got to remain classified for 25 years. So if a quantum computer really will exist in 10 years, then these guys are already 15 years too late to quantum-proof their encryption. \n\nSo while many scientists around the world are racing to try to build a quantum computer, us cryptographers are urgently looking to reinvent encryption to protect us long before that day comes. We're looking for new, hard mathematical problems. We're looking for problems that, just like factorization, can be used on our smartphones and on our laptops today. But unlike factorization, we need these problems to be so hard that they're even unbreakable with a quantum computer. \n\nIn recent years, we've been digging around a much wider realm of mathematics to look for such problems. We've been looking at numbers and objects that are far more exotic and far more abstract than the ones that you and I are used to, like the ones on our calculators. And we believe we've found some geometric problems that just might do the trick. Now, unlike those two- and three-dimensional geometric problems that we used to have to try to solve with pen and graph paper in high school, most of these problems are defined in well over 500 dimensions. So not only are they a little hard to depict and solve on graph paper, but we believe they're even out of the reach of a quantum computer. So though it's early days, it's here that we are putting our hope as we try to secure our digital world moving into its quantum future. \n\nJust like all of the other scientists, we cryptographers are tremendously excited at the potential of living in a world alongside quantum computers. They could be such a force for good. But no matter what technological future we live in, our secrets will always be a part of our humanity. And that is worth protecting.\n\n"

    "text": "Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient. So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal. Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator. Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it, came back for more. This was scientific management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work. It was super efficient. \n\nWell, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day. \n\nEfficiency works really well when you can predict exactly what you're going to need. But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along -- kids, customers, coconuts -- well, then efficiency is no longer your friend. \n\nThis has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected is becoming the norm. It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out. Why? Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone from being complicated to being complex -- which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat themselves regularly. It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact. And it means that expertise won't always suffice, because the system just keeps changing too fast. \n\nSo what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now. It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when. We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories are going to flood. It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty. In an environment that defies so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond. \n\nSo if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle, how should we address the future? What kind of thinking is really going to help us? What sort of talents must we be sure to defend? I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous. \n\nOne example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI. We know there will be more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what. So we can't plan. But we can prepare. So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out. So some of those vaccines will never be used. That's inefficient. But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution. Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other. But those relationships take time to develop, time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out. So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those may never be used. That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust. \n\nYou can see robust thinking in financial services, too. In the past, banks used to hold much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it, is what made the banks so fragile in the first place. Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient. But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises. \n\nCountries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one. The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction, that information may very well come too late. \n\nYou can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do. Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might suddenly become unstable. It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks. It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have too many friends. But if you're stuck in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it? Try some experiments. \n\nIn the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday. The nurses hated it. So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment. Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide? \n\nIn his experiment, Jos found the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent. When I asked Jos what had surprised him about his experiment, he just kind of laughed and he said, \"Well, I had no idea it could be so easy to find such a huge improvement, because this isn't the kind of thing you can know or predict sitting at a desk or staring at a computer screen.\" So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world. But in every new country it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly and unpredictably different. \n\nOf course, not all experiments work. Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized. Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works. So now he's trying teachers. Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery. \n\nIn England -- I was about to say in the UK, but in England -- \n\nIn England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens. The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do and the data-driven conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams do exactly the same thing. So they risked an experiment. They took the whole team away, even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago. This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right? \n\nBut what they found was that the players came back with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity. And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager calls \"poise\" -- an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other. Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it. \n\n\nAt a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything that made any difference to the company's productivity. So she devised an experiment that she calls \"Love Week\": a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it. It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting. But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company more productive. \n\nPreparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery -- in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength. They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention. And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills. \n\nBut in our growing dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills. Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off. The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves. The more -- \n\nThe more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend looking at their patients. The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids. The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves. And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have. \n\n\nWhat all of these technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality onto a world that is infinitely surprising. What gets left out? Anything that can't be measured -- which is just about everything that counts. \n\nOur growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled, more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world. \n\nNow, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone through existential crises, when they teetered on the brink of collapse. These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations. Many men wept just remembering. So I asked them: \"What kept you going through this?\" \n\nAnd they all had exactly the same answer. \"It wasn't data or technology,\" they said. \"It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going.\" \n\nOne added, \"It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy.\" \n\nBut then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives, and I asked them, \"Who are your friends at work?\" And they just looked blank. \n\n\"There's no time.\" \n\"They're too busy.\" \n\"It's not efficient.\" \n\nWho, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come? \n\nAnyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny. The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there. \n\nBut that's OK, because we have so much imagination -- if we use it. We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration -- if we apply them. We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before. Lose those skills, and we are adrift. But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose.\n\n"

    "text": "Be a Better Fundraiser\n\nBecause if you want to change the world, you have to know how to pay for it. I'm not talking about being a good person -- you can do that for free. I'm talking about if you want to create something, start something, galvanize a community, improve the lives of others, run for office. \n\nEvery day, great ideas die on the vine, because they don't have capital to get off the ground. And all of the work, the thought, the vision that goes into the idea, isn't worth much if you can't pay your bills. And while most of the greatest social movements in history were powered purely by an idea and people's belief in that idea, real change and impact require resources. \n\nReal people do this work, they need real change, real impact and resources to actually make it happen. The people that believe in this work have to have the support and the resources to do it. That's where I come in. I get essential resources into the hands of people and visionaries on the front lines, doing work that matters. \n\nWe spend the majority of our waking hours working. We spend more time working than we do with our loved ones. So I decided early on that I have to love my work, and it has to add value. And while I would love to be one of these people who spearheads social change from the ground up, the thing I realized early on in my nonprofit career is that the thing I'm good at, the thing I'm really good at, is raising money. And I love it. I think it is a privilege to work alongside bold, ambitious, optimistic leaders and the organizations they serve. \n\nSo I teach people how to do the thing I'm good at, because the more people that learn how to be good at my end of this work, the more work will get done. \n\nAnd I teach everyone. I teach CEOs and presidents, and boards of directors and EDs. I teach development directors in all sorts of teams and nonprofit newbies, social change agents and candidates. I teach anyone that wants to do something extraordinary how to fund their dream. My dream is that there will be more people like me doing this work well and that development will be an undergraduate course at universities, so that fundraising animals like me will find this job out of the gate, instead of discovering it years later, accidentally. I even have the curriculum developed, but short of overhauling undergraduate course requirements, I think tonight's probably a good first step to get people to think about fundraising more as an opportunity and less as a dirty word. \n\nIf you want to change the world, you have to know how to pay for it. To do that well, you have to understand three big things. Your feelings about wealth and money, the importance of building relationships, and how to ask for what you want. \n\nLet's start at the top, your feelings about wealth and money. What is your relationship to money? Money is complicated, it makes everyone squeamish, it makes everyone act kind of weird. Anyone who's ever had to split the check after dinner with friends can tell you this. Imagine what it was like before Venmo. \n\nTo help people learn how to raise money, you have to help them understand their deal with money, because everybody has baggage. Grew up poor? Baggage. Grew up rich? Baggage. Mad or envious that other people have more money than you? Baggage. Think people with money are smarter than you? Baggage. \n\nFeel guilty that you have more money than other people? That's some first-class baggage. \n\nIt's still baggage, people, it's still baggage. So whatever your deal is with your baggage, you have to reconcile it if you're going to be able to ask for money. And here's a little tip about asking people for money. The only difference about really wealthy people and us is that they have more money than us. That's it. Don't overcomplicate it. They come with their own baggage. \n\nWhen you think about how to do this work, it's important to remember that money makes the world go round. You hear that all the time, but it's true. Whether you're a nonprofit, for-profit, or you pay your own bills. We often feel like talking about it is this icky, embarrassing, ugly thing, but it's just money. And it's a fact of life. So how you feel about it directly affects how you approach it. \n\nLike everyone else when I started out in this work, I had to examine and understand my own feelings about wealth and money. And I had to learn how to separate them from how I feel about raising money for important causes. How I feel about asking for money to help people do good work in the world is not the same as how I feel about asking for money for myself. This is an important distinction. When I go and talk to someone, I'm not asking them to pay my mortgage. I'm giving them an opportunity to invest in an idea that's going to change the world for the better. Why should I feel bad about that? If you want to be good at raising money, you have to be able to reframe the ask, both for yourself and for other people, as an opportunity. \n\nNext, you have to get prepared to build some relationships. People give to people, they don't just give to ideas. And if they don't believe in the person running the place, you're already dead in the water. This is true whether you're in stocks or venture capital, politics or nonprofits. \n\nBuilding a relationship with people takes work. You have to care about more than just what you want or need, you have to also value what someone else wants or needs. I know, it's a shocking, terrible idea. But oftentimes, closing gifts is understanding the person, more than it's important to know the product. And if you think building a relationship with people takes work, building a relationship with someone you're asking for money from takes work, and it takes homework. Have you done any research? Do you have any idea what they care about? Do you know why they should invest in your work? Can you answer that question in less than 30 seconds? If you can't, the meeting is going to be pretty rough. And the answer can't be \"Because they're super rich and they live in your zip code.\" \n\nWhen you talk to people and understand what they care about, it has to be in person. Fundraising is relational, it's not transactional. And you have to ask them questions. When I sit down with a donor, it goes something like this. \"Hi, thanks so much for seeing me. How have you been? Did you guys go anywhere fun over holiday? Nice, I love Mexico. Do you always go to the same place? Oh, that's awesome! Are those your kids? They're so cute. How old are they? Where are they in school? Oh, that's a great school, are you guys very involved there? Your spouse in on the board? How's that? How did you guys meet? Oh, at Santa Clara, that's awesome. Are you super involved in the alumni network? So interesting. Where do you guys live, again? That's great. Is that your boat?\" \n\nI literally go through all of these things, right. And you know why? Because guess what I know now. I know they're out of 120 grand a year in schooling for the next 12 years. Right? Spouse is on the board of the kids' school, I know they're out of 100K probably. It's a six-figure. They're both involved in their school alumni, that's probably 25K. They told me they live on the Upper East Side -- I can look up their apartment online and find out what their mortgage is. And I know they own a second home in Mexico. Oh, and they own a boat. Which is like funny money, right? So what I now understand -- \n\nIt's true. What I now understand is that their 1,000-dollar gift is probably more of a starter gift. And I should be thinking about ways to help them partner with us and invest in a more meaningful way. \n\nI know this sounds a tad mercenary. I'm not confused about how it sounds. But here's what I want to tell you, because this is the part that all my clients always want to skip, because they think it's the fluff and it's not important. If you don't understand what they care about and what they value, how are you ever going to be able to tell them about your work, right? I want them to fund our work, I do. But I also want them to have a really meaningful experience as a donor, so that they feel like we're partners and they're not an ATM, right? \nSo it's important to ask the questions, because the more you know about them and you know what they value, the more you can steer the conversation in a direction about your work that will resonate for them. And once you get past the get-to-know-you part, you get into the fun stuff, like, \"Why are you philanthropic at all?\" Right? \"Why do you invest in new ideas? Do you want giving back to be a value you pass on to your children? Can we help you do that?\" It's really awesome, it's meaningful, and remember, it's a conversation, it's not a cross examination, it's not an interview. Don't walk in there and tell them everything you already know about them, because you did your research. You don't get extra points for knowing how to use Google. It's 75 percent them talking, 25 percent you listening. It's better to be a good listener than a good showman. \n\nAnd once you understand what they care about, you can talk to them about what you care about. You can tell them about you. Now, when you do this, don't get too deep into the weeds, or you'll lose them. It's a lot like when I sit down with guys in finance, right, and I say, you know, \"How's work?\" I'm looking for, like, a thumbs up, thumbs down. But what I get sometimes is a long description of how the markets are trending, and my brain leaves my body and starts to think about what time my dry cleaner closes. \n\nLike, I don't have capacity for that. And they don't have capacity for that level detail of our work. If they want it, they'll ask you the questions. \n\nIt's this thing that happens over and over, because -- here's an example. I worked with this CEO once, and I was hired to teach him how to talk to human people, like a human person. \n\nIt was a very difficult job. So, he kept getting great donor meetings, and he wasn't closing any gifts. And I could not figure out what the problem was, so finally, I was like, \"I'm going to come with you.\" So I went with him to meetings, and what would happen was, he was getting into such detail with the donors that their eyes were glazing over, and then after he was done with his 15-minute pitch, they literally would say -- this happened, like, three times in a row -- \"God, that sounds great. Congratulations. Keep up the good work.\" And that was the meeting, which was obviously not the outcome we were looking for. So, he couldn't understand what I was trying to say to him, that I finally, in an act of sheer desperation, was like ... \"You know what I love? I love NASA. I love NASA. I think it is unbelievably amazing we have figured out how to get a person to the Moon. I think it's awesome. I think the idea of getting someone to the Moon, and they walk on the Moon, and I love rocket ships. I love rocket ships, rocket ships are amazing. But if you start to tell me about the rocket ship, and how it gets to the Moon, and the math and the science equations, on how the rocket ship gets to the Moon, I promise you, I will hang myself with my own hair.\" \n\nI was like, \"That is not how you tell people about your work. What is the need?\" Like, what's the point, right? How do you address the need, why are you better at it than anybody else? And what can you do to make it about them? How can they help you get to the Moon? That's the good stuff. If you're able to do that, you're probably ready to make the ask. \n\nNow, I don't expect everyone to be super excited to ask people for money. That's why development is an actual profession and not an awkward hobby. \n\nNaturally great fundraisers love people, they can and will talk to anyone, they can find common ground with anyone, they're your friends that talk to people in the elevator or at the grocery store. They believe in the work required to both build relationships and keep them. And they naturally have a high tolerance for rejection. \n\nBut I don't expect everyone to be a natural, and you don't have to be a natural to raise money. You just have to respect the people and the process, and do the work. Will you reconcile your baggage? Will you commit to build relationships? If you will, you're ready to make the ask. And the ask is oftentimes as simple as using the phrase \"Would you consider?\" Would you consider becoming a monthly donor? Would you consider increasing your support to 100 dollars? Would you consider investing in our work at the one-million-dollar level? \n\n\"Would you consider\" does a couple of awesome things. One, it gives the donor an easy way out. Like, they can say \"no\" without it being \"yes-no.\" And two, it gives you a second ask. \"Well, what would you consider?\" \n\n\nIt's good, right? \n\n\nWhen you do this, remember, you're not asking for yourself. You're asking on behalf of all of the people you serve or are touched by your genius. This isn't a personal favor, right? Feel proud of the ask -- it's incredible that you do this work. Don't try to be someone you're not, you're going to go to these meetings and think you need to big-shot it. Be yourself, authenticity matters, nobody likes a phony. Just be yourself. \n\nAnd please, please don't torpedo your own ask. What I mean by this is don't walk into the meeting and say -- I had an ED that did this all the time, I stopped inviting him. He'd say, \"We're not here today to ask you for money.\" \n\nYes, we are! \n\nThat's exactly, literally, why we're here today. Don't do that. Don't say, \"Whatever you can do to help.\" That is hands down the fastest way to get the smallest possible gift someone thinks they can give you and get away with. Not kidding. And don't take it back. Once you've made the ask -- \"Would you consider supporting us at the 10,000-dollar level? Or the five? Or the two? Or one? You know what? Take the year off. You're the best, thanks!\" Don't do that! Ask the question, wait till 10, count to 10 before you speak again, keep your face like this. \n\nThey are grown-ups. They have all the power in this situation. They can answer the question. Don't take it back. \n\nWhich brings me to my favorite. Don't ask, don't get. If you don't make an actual ask, no one will give you actual money. And if no one gives you actual money, you actually can't do anything with it. It's very simple -- don't ask, don't get. \n\nListen, I would love to live in a world where we didn't have to ask people for money to do important work that will change people's lives. I would love to not have to teach people how to make a case for the importance of feeding and housing and educating people. But this is the world that we live in, and if we're committed to doing this work, and doing it well, we have to be as committed to the art of funding this work as we are to the art of executing it. I'm going to repeat that, because I think it's really important. We have to be as committed to the art of funding our work as we are to the art of executing it. And at its core, the art of funding the work means that we have to truly believe that the purpose and the privilege of our work is to provide people with an extraordinary way to use their wealth that will change people's lives. It's an opportunity, because at its core, that's what it is. And how great is that?\n\n"

    "text": "Be Your Best Capitalist\n\nGreetings, Sentients. And welcome to another scintillating episode of Solutions to Problems. I\u2019m your host, *dolphin noise*, or as the humans call me, Loaf, and speaking of humans, this is my co-host, Janet. Say hello, Janet. \n\n Hello, Janet!\n\n Classic human joke! She intentionally misinterpreted my request!\n\n Yeah, e\u2019re not very original, which is why we humans have over 200 adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, and only put on the same three plays by Shakespeare.\n\n For those of you joining us for the first time, this a show where we help create harmony from the chaos of interpersonal relationships. If you have a problem you\u2019d like us to solve, please e-mail us at problemsrequiringsolutions@gmail.com, or film an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes inspired by the problem. Who knows! You might even solve the problem yourself in the process of coming up with a script.\n\n There still hasn\u2019t been an adaptation made entirely with cybernetically enhanced kittens, so there\u2019s still groundbreaking territory for you to cover. Gosh, Loaf. It feels kind of empty in the studio today without a special guest! There\u2019s\u2026 just so much space! I could lay on the floor, or float on the ceiling, if we were in a part of the station with minimal gravity, although I guess I could do that anyway even if there was another person in here.\n\n We all could, Janet, but we\u2019re currently in 0.7 Earth gravity and therefore lightly tethered to the ground by our own weight. Even without a special guest, we still have three problems needing three solutions, so let\u2019s get started.\n\nPhone rings\n\nDear Janet & Loaf,\n\nI'm a Flisnorp who\u2019s also an underwater artist from the Octopia trench in Grenadis III. In my spare time, I have been singing with my husband and my wife in a popular soul and R&B group called The Philosophical Drifters, where I cosplay as Elvis and Andy Warhol. I love the music, and the band is very true to their name---they\u2019re made up of people who drift in and out of the group. Every time someone leaves, they have to find a replacement that sounds and thinks exactly like them, so the group continues to have the same musical sound. At first I found this to be a charming and novel idea, but lately I\u2019m realizing that the band might just be a subversive advertisement for Beautiphonics LLC. All of our new songs are about claw wraps, and all our old songs have been amended to include these beatnik-style spoken word sections about wanting shinier horns and scales. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure if these products even work. I tried the claw wraps, and I think they were just watered down hydrofluoric acid treatments. I want to leave the band, but finding a replacement has proven to be vexing. There are just not enough underwater art school students who have a smooth tenor voice and a penchant for role-playing as a famous pop artist from Earth. To make things worse, my spouses are really into the group and their business selling Beautiphonics products. I'm starting to feel really alone here. Is there a way out of this dilemma, or will I have to give up my family and my favorite pastime just to keep my cave free of junk?\n\nSincerely,\n\nHiding In The Closet to Avoid This Scale Scrub Party \n\n Well, I think you just have to give up your family and your favorite pastime just to keep your cave free of junk, Hiding In The Closet to Avoid This Scale Scrub Party.\n\n I don\u2019t know Janet, I wouldn\u2019t give up on them quite yet. \n\n I would! I think getting out of the band is the easiest part of this, but having to convince your family that the multi-level marketing scheme they\u2019re in is creepy? Soooo hard! They\u2019re all really culty, you know?\n\n It can be difficult to reprogram someone if they\u2019ve been indoctrinated into an MLM. But I\u2019m wary of using that word. My planet has had its share of actual cults, and it\u2019s really not the same as selling useless paraphernalia to one\u2019s loved ones.. I mean, sure they make promises they can\u2019t keep, use your friends and family against you, won\u2019t let you leave, and gaslight you constantly. But.. what was I saying? \n\n You were saying that I shouldn\u2019t call the very weird pushy marketing group a cult.\n\n Oh. Well, now that I\u2019ve thought about it for a moment: they are definitely a cult.\n\n Thaank you. I personally maintain that you shouldn\u2019t trust anyone or anything who tries to sell you something on the basis that you can achieve some kind of mode of perfection just by like, trying some bogus hair product made out of real Fliznorpan rocks, or that selling someone else\u2019s products is the way to make tons of money when, really, there are better and more efficient ways to be your best capitalist self and destroy the lives of others for your own personal gain!\n\n Sometimes I feel like I agree with you in practical terms while wildly disagreeing with you in ideological terms, Janet. It\u2019s an unusual sensation.\n\n People are always saying that, like, \u201cI thought you were right until you just kept talking!\u201d Which is super rude. Why would me saying more make me less right? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n Getting back to our letter-writer, you may be able to salvage your relationship without getting yourself drawn further into this nonsense, but you should be open to the possibility that you also may not. Set clear boundaries. You can stop participating in this band without finding a replacement. \n\n I\u2019m unsure how you managed to find so many replacements in the first place because your band sounds really bad.\n\n Musical tastes vary wildly throughout the galaxy, Janet. Fliznorp music based on human visual art is very popular among Silpurians. Human music based on Silpuri gymnastics routines is extremely popular among Fliznorps. But, Humans hate Silpuri music based on Fliznorp tax codes. Cultural cross-pollination is fascinating.\n\n Yeah! Yeah, it is fascinating. It\u2019s very fascinating, and I should feel bad for calling things bad when there is no objective standard for taste in the universe, especially considering no two beings have identical ways of experiencing art, etcetera, etcetera! I\u2019m not sure how you can have a band that\u2019s resistant to change that is also still capable of writing new songs. Like, you say everyone thinks exactly the same as their predecessors, but that can\u2019t be true as the content of your songs are changing. They can find a new\u2026 Elvis.. Warhol\u2026.man? Those aren\u2019t even similar people! But okay, sure! And you can go about finding new things to do in your spare time. With your family, maybe just mention that you\u2019re considering leaving Beautiphonics or whatever it is, and see how they react? It\u2019s possible they\u2019re having the same doubts you are, and just hiding it better.\n\n Let\u2019s hope for that outcome. As my Untranslatable parent used to say, \u201cHope for the best, prepare for the worst, expect a thoroughly mediocre and boring third option, and make sure you don\u2019t wake the Frazdgar.\u201d Anything else for this letter, Janet?\n\n Um, I don\u2019t think so. Ooh, I think this next one is from your planet, Loaf! Or. I think it is, if I can read the eee eee eees correctly.\n\nPhone rings.\n\nDear *Dolphin noise* and Janet,\n\nI am writing in with a problem I\u2019m having with my broodbrother. I\u2019m actually writing on behalf of his wives, husbands, and interlocutors. They are all very concerned about the fact that he went on walkabout, as many third protohusbands do, but rather than returning to the mudpits to tell all the broodlings tales of his travels he has remained on Earf, being an intergalactic radio host. He\u2019s not returning any of my calls, e-mails, genetically modified rodents or any other methods of communication I have tried. How do I get him to come home and fulfill his parenting duties? There are seven broodlings he hasn\u2019t even - [BEEP AS THE LETTER CUTS OFF]\n\n Are you sure we do not have a different letter? I did not get a chance to review this letter, I am not at all sure this letter went through the appropriate channels.\n\n Well, I\u2019m like, never allowed to review letters anymore, so don\u2019t act like you\u2019re so special. And like, why did you stop the tape like that? Because it definitely did go through appropriate channels, actually, because it is in this pile that Mr. Xorfus okayed?\n\n[There\u2019s the sound of a mechanical arm moving, indicating Melody\u2019s presence]\n\n Oh, it was definitely approved.\n\n See? Thanks Melody. \n\n You\u2019re welcome.\n\n Everyone, that was Melody, our ever present station AI slash also my on and off again girlfriend. Anyways, can we please just finish the tape-\n\n [Clears a non-existent throat and interrupts Janet] Ever present station AI, and not currently your girlfriend-\n\n Oh.\n\n In part because I\u2019m a little offended every time you joke about turning me off and on again.\n\n That\u2019s not what that means in this context! And, are you\u2026 really\u2026 sure? I mean, nevermind.\n\n Riiiight. Mr. Xorfus and I will have to have words about this at some point in the future. By \u201cthis\u201d I mean this letter as I have made my thought on this relationship clear to him already. For now, perhaps an alternate letter could be found.\n\n Oh yeah, well, he\u2019s made a lot of thoughts clear to me too, but that doesn\u2019t mean I listen. To go back to doing our jobs, we always have a few back-ups in case something turns out to be extremely offensive to a culture we aren\u2019t as familiar with. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to finish the recording? It seemed really fun-\n\n I am quite sure. I have asked many times that my work and my personal correspondence be kept separate, and certain people seem unable to grasp that concept.\n\n THIS ONE WAS ABOUT YOU! Oh my god, I thought maybe there was just like, another one of you guys hosting a show here. I mean, I can definitely tell all of you apart, of course. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Loaf! You have seven broodlings you haven\u2019t even a thing with!\n\n I promise you they will survive.\n\n I don\u2019t know, Loaf, they seem pretty distressed that you aren\u2019t mudpitting or whatever! Wow, and I thought I was a bad... Well, I\u2019m a bad child and girlfriend, not really a bad parent because I don\u2019t have children.  I thought I was an extremely avoidant person? Let\u2019s go with that. Wow, I thought I was an extremely avoidant entity.\n\n It is more complicated than that, Janet. \n\n Most things are like, complicated. Explaining to my mom that no, I don\u2019t remember that because I permanently altered my own timeline is complicated. This is just family.\n\n This is the twelfth message we\u2019ve received from them in the past two weeks. \n\n Thank you for this important message, Melody.\n\n You\u2019re very welcome, Janet. You organics are so weird about \u201cfamily\u201d units. My creator just popped me out of the microchip, and sent me off to my first job a few minutes after naming me.\n\n Cold, but efficient. \n\n Mmm.\n\n I appreciate the concept of a life without any ties except the ones you choose to make, but my parents still have me on their phone plan, and it really saves me a lot of money every month. Also, TWELVE MESSAGES, Loaf? That\u2019s more than what SAMANTHA has sent me.\n\n The last thing I\u2019m going to say on this subject is that our families are exponentially more complicated than human ones. \u2026and I may not have been entirely truthful about the extent to which my gender is expected to be involved in child-rearing. \n\n Ugh, fiiine. Be like that. Whatever, we don\u2019t need another letter. I think it\u2019s time for a sponsor message because I\u2019m pretty bummed out about not getting to hear the rest of the message.\n\n I still have the recording.\n\n We\u2019ll talk later-\n\nMelody [seductively]: Yes, we will.\n\n -and not just about that.\n\n Ooh.\n\n You will not be talking later. At least not in regards to this recording, which I will be having Frankie delete. You will of course retain the ability to speak.\n\n Ugh, whatever. This week\u2019s sponsor message is from Centauri Hovercrafts, the leader in luxury Hovercrafts. They\u2019re proud to announce the release of their latest model, the UFO V. The UFO V has an AI driver, advanced safety technology, slime, and a deluxe hardwood interior. \n\n Centauri Hovercrafts has won most dependable hovercraft four years running, highest maximum altitude for three years running, and \u201cmost attractive shade of mauve\u201d for the last six weeks.\n\n In this mauve, you won\u2019t be an unidentified flying object for much longer. The UFO V, available now at a Centauri Hovercrafts dealership near you. Call now and ask about affordable financing plans - no blood samples required. [In a cheerier voice] Okay, well, that was our paycheck.\n\n Without blood samples, how do the tracker drones find you if you can\u2019t pay?\n\n Hoho, that\u2019s easy. Facial recognition of course.\n\n Wow, the future really is here.\n\n Facial recognition has existed for centuries, Loaf, what are you talking about?\n\n For humans, maybe, but you only have one face. Relatively simple.\n\n Oh! Well, uh, we\u2019re getting off track. Let\u2019s move on, and play our next letter.\n\nPhone Rings\n\nDear Loaf and Janet,\n\nI have a work problem. I don\u2019t know if you know about this alternate reality game \u201cPocket Creatures All Around Ultimate Crossover Edition\u201d. It\u2019s really hip with the young people these days. They wear their alternate reality contact lenses and it lets them see all of these creatures everywhere and then they can catch them and use them to fight each other. I\u2019m sure it's fun but it's just not my cup of tea. The problem is everyone at work is doing it. I\u2019ll get all-staff e-mails telling me that there\u2019s a Charasaur or a Venastoise two blocks from the office, then everyone will drop what they\u2019re doing to go catch it or battle it or whatever. Then when they get back they\u2019ll have reassigned me from all my projects. I feel like my career is being held back because I don\u2019t want to catch virtual monsters with them. I don\u2019t know how to bring this up with my bosses without them thinking I\u2019m a buzzkill or a killjoy (buzzkill evolves from killjoy I think? I dunno, I\u2019ve picked up a lot from listening.) Anyway, what should I do?\n\nSincerely,\n\nDon\u2019t gotta catch any of \u2018em if I don\u2019t want to\n\n Absolutely I know POCKET CREATURES ALL AROUND ULTIMATE CROSSOVER EDITION. Anyone not living under a rock, which is most of us because we live on top of rocks, generally, except for the Mole People of Senulas VII, who, as we all know, live in volcanic lava beds, knows about Pocket Creatures, and even the Mole People probably know about Pocket Creatures. You know what they say, you\u2019ve made your volcanic lava bed, now lie in it. I\u2019m sure someone says that. \n\n Who is the \u201cthey\u201d here? Is it me? Its me, isn\u2019t it?\n\n No, it\u2019s just. I don\u2019t know. I never know who \u201cthey\u201d is. Anyway, Pocket Creatures are super fun, but. Not for everyone, I guess, clearly. Do you play, Loaf?\n\n Yes, clearly not for everyone. Hmphm. For some of us, it\u2019s another reason we\u2019re not currently dating.\n\n What!\n\n So while Janet\u2019s talking about Pocket Creatures, I\u2019m going to do something more fun, like, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe, watch MS Paint dry. [mechanical whirring]\n\n That\u2019s- That\u2019s not even a thing! That metaphor doesn\u2019t even make sense, and it\u2019s not my fault that you hate joy! [pause] Do you play Loaf?\n\n I was really into augmented reality when I was younger, but eventually I got to the point where I had no idea what reality actually was and I had to quit cold-turkey. \n\n Boring.\n\n So no, I never got into this particular one. I hear it's based on a 21st century human video game which was based on a 20th century human cartoon which was based on a 19th century human epic poem?\n\n You know, I think that all sounds correct, although maybe not in that order. Mary Shelley is really the foundation of so much human culture, and no one ever gives her the credit for Pocket Monsters she really deserves.\n\n Even if I\u2019m not familiar with this game, I definitely understand what it's like to have a huge part of workplace culture be inaccessible to you, or to feel like something that should be a leisure activity has become unexpectedly mandatory. \n\n It\u2019s definitely unfair that something completely unrelated to your work is stopping you from having face time with your colleagues. The easy solution is, obviously, to join them, but if you don\u2019t want to do that, you might want to consider mentioning it to your bosses. I know you\u2019re worried they\u2019ll think you\u2019re ruining the fun, but they may not realize how excluded you feel.\n\n Ultimately, how they respond to this is going to reveal something about the culture of the workplace and what they really value. And depending on how that turns out it might be time to look for other employment. But you won\u2019t know that until you try and set appropriate boundaries. \n\n Like, Boundarymon, whose power is to set boundaries, but literal, physical boundaries? Which I guess are just force fields at that point? And it makes them sooo hard to catch. You have to spend at least ten orbs trying to catch them sometimes if you don\u2019t have an alternating current type on your team, because the direct current types don\u2019t have enough voltage. Ugh. So frustrating.\n\n \u2026 Yes. Like that, but with the metaphorical boundaries between your work and your personal life. \n\n Oh, right. Workplace boundaries. I\u2019ve had a lot of trainings about thooose lately. I wonder, also, if he could just go with them? Not necessarily play the game, but just hang out while they catch their Beezelbumbles. That way he\u2019s there when the important conversations about projects or whatever are happening.\n\n That does seem like a somewhat logical compromise, given how little we know about this letter-writer. \n\n I wonder if they\u2019re a different species than their co-workers? Not all beings can use AR contact lenses, seeing as you like, need a certain kind of eyes to put contact lenses. If just hanging out with them while they play doesn\u2019t work, they could try talking to SR, but if SR also plays Pocket Creatures, maybe a new job is in order?\n\n Much like our first letter writer, this one should go into a conversation hopeful, but also prepared to sever ties if things don\u2019t work out. Cautious optimism is the order of the day.\n\n I think that\u2019s it for this problem. Let\u2019s keep moving before I think too hard about the fact that I\u2019m maybe single right now. Really wasn\u2019t prepared for this today.\n\nPhone Rings.\n\nDear Loaf and \n\nI\u2019m hoping you have some advice for, well, pretty much everyone on my planet. You see, we\u2019re a young colony. We don\u2019t have a lot of ships. A few weeks ago we detected a huge asteroid on a collision course with our planet. Those with the means to do so evacuated, but for most of us it was too late. We resigned ourselves to oblivion. And then, we did what any doomed society would do. We lived. We lived like there was no tomorrow, because we believed there would not be. We did all of the drugs we had. We had sex with everyone who was willing. We destroyed things for fun. Money became useless as everyone struggled to spend everything they had on final experiences, but of course no one wanted to buy because what would they do with the useless money? It was a glorious, chaotic wreck, especially the final day as we all knew our doom was approaching.\n\nAnd then the next morning\u2026 we woke up. The asteroid had missed. The predictions had been wrong. And we had destroyed our society for nothing. \n\nI can\u2019t look any of my coworkers in the eye anymore. Everyone is embarrassed, or resentful, or, or pregnant, or addicted to every kind of drug available, and everyone destroyed each other\u2019s property. Law enforcement is a joke, especially since most of them went rogue and started looting. How do we pick up the pieces?\n\nSincerely,\n\nIt\u2019s not over \u2018till it's over\n\n Look, things happen sometimes.\n\n There is a Vimthor-gut lining here, which is that you are not all dead, and probably a lot of tension has been released. A lot of secrets are out in the open. In a way I think what happened to your society could be sort of helpful, though I acknowledge in other ways it is extremely destructive.\n\n We\u2019ve all had some really wild nights with some regrets after, and in your case sometimes a series of nights driven by fear of our own mortality in wake of a disaster. I think it\u2019s time for everyone to make a plan to get their life back together, you know, make those doctor\u2019s appointments. Get checked for all the easily transmitted diseases and pregnancies. Pay your bills. Call whatever of your family remains. See if your jobs still exist. Luckily, almost everyone is stewing in their own shame right now, so in a way, the shame DOESN\u2019T EXIST. Everyone\u2019s shame should just cancel out. If you\u2019re a doctor, you know, actually go back to work because you\u2019re going to be really important right now. I think also if you\u2019re looking for a job in your new society because your previous business no longer exists, daycare may be a booming business approximately one gestation cycle from now, so maybe it\u2019s time to consider a career switch.\n\n[Mechanical whirring]\n\n Or\u2026 this seems like the kind of experience that might make a person want to, oh, I don\u2019t know, go back to their home planet and meet any offspring they maybe never have met.\n\n Oh, you\u2019re back.\n\n I am. Did you miss me?\n\n [nervously] Hahah, no?\n\n That sounds like an entirely different problem, Melody, one which we are not discussing today.\n\n Um, rude much? Melody, I think is making an excellent point. If you have family off world, this is definitely the time to reunite with them! Maybe you can get back on your feet with a little distance from all your plentiful mistakes. Not everyone is actively avoiding their children, Loaf.\n\n I am not actively - I am not getting into this. Question for the letter-writer - have you fired your scientists yet? Now might also be a time to consider a new career in asteroid prediction, since obviously that field could use some new blood.\n\n Yeah, I\u2019m sensing some firings in the future for asteroid predictors on your planet. Definitely another growing field. Also, great job actively avoiding the subject, Loaf. Do you think, perhaps, you have a problem that needs solving?\n\n I think Loaf  has many problems that need solving.\n\n Whatever problems I have, I will solve on my own time, and not involve nosy co-workers and workplace AIs.\n\n Technically, you\u2019re the nosiest, as I have no noses and you have fourteen. The number fourteen is greater than zero.\n\n That\u2019s-\n\n Oh, I know what you meant, but I\u2019ve been trying out wordplay. Working on my tight five!\n\n I admit that was an effective subversion of a human turn of phrase. And on that note, I think we are out of time. Thank you listeners, we hope you have a lovely rest of whatever unit of time your planet uses.\n\n We haven\u2019t solved the problem yet, though, and we definitely still have time. And this time the problem is why you are avoiding your children and also, we should say something more definitive for our letter writer. We just kind of blew that planetwide apocalyptic panic off as a wild weekend night, and by we, I mean I. I did that.\n\n Oh, on a cosmic scale it was a wild weekend night. Many civilizations intentionally trigger cyclical apocalypse panics as a way of renewing their societies. The Mch\u2019 Varan for example. Actually that\u2019s the only one I can think of, but if they can survive one of these every two hundred years or so, I\u2019m sure your planet will be just fine.\n\n Humans used to repeatedly wipe out other human civilizations and eventually - well, actually, I guess they mostly just died and it was all really sad, or they suffered through years of the effects of colonization even long after the original settlers had- Oh, we were talking about parties. Yeah! I think you\u2019ll figure things out letter writer. Be patient with yourself and also your whole planet! In preparing for a huge trauma, you accidentally traumatized yourselves, and that takes time to heal from. Wishing you super the best. Definitely get tested though, for everything. You should all get tested. Speaking of children, Loaf, what are you going to do about all these seven broodlings you haven\u2019t yet thinged? The thinging seemed really important.\n\n They have thirteen other parental figures, Janet! That\u2019s still eleven more than most broodlings on your planet. As Melody would say, fourteen is more than two.\n\n I would say that. Good job, Loaf, on achieving basic arithmetic. You know who could perhaps use some help learning arithmetic? Oh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps the children you abandoned \n\n Um\u2026\u2026\u2026. I mean, you know, with humans, on average, each child has two parents, but in practice it could be anywhere from one to eight. One is actually pretty common, and, I mean, some kids might even have more than eight. Polyamorous communes can get super large. But, sure, whatever. This wasn\u2019t a change of subject. Most of us grow up functional. Unfortunately, listeners, we\u2019ll have to leave Loaf\u2019s shirking of parental duties to another episode, as we are genuinely this time, almost out of time. Good night gentle listeners, and probably you should call whatever close relatives you still attempt to maintain a relationship with \u2018cause they would appreciate it.\n\n[End theme plays]\n\nSolutions to Problems was created by and features the voices of Austin Hendricks and Nathan Comstock. It is produced and musically scored by Michael F. Gill. Season 2 was written by Austin, Nathan and Michael. Our theme is by Thomas Dwyer. The voice of Melody is Chloe Cunha. Loaf\u2019s broodmate was played by Bridget Kraynick. This episode\u2019s letters were read by MASHA, Gillian Daniels, Grayson Hendricks.

    "text": "Gut Microbes\n\nNow, I know it might be easy to think that microbes are bad, especially for infants, but research has in fact proven the opposite. And the truth might be a little bit more complex, but it's actually way more interesting. It seems that we need microbes to be programmed for good health, but not just any microbes, we need the right combination. We succeed best with the little microbial bodies we have adapted to coexist with during evolution. And I guess it won't surprise you to learn that we start acquiring that right combination right at birth. Well, at least some of us do. \n\nBabies born by C-section and babies born vaginally aren't the same when it comes to microbial start to life, and after birth there are countless different early life events and circumstances that further modulate the way the gut microbiota is developing, such as the medications that might be prescribed for the infant or the mother, number of pets and siblings in the family, as well as level of hygiene at home, and, in this case, it's actually better if it's not that perfectly clean all the time. And also nutrition, both mothers and infants. All of these events and circumstances play a huge role in the gut microbial development and that has a huge impact on the lifelong health of that baby. \n\nAnd I'm not talking about small health implications here. I'm talking about the big stuff. Microbes we acquire or do not acquire affect our likelihood of developing diseases like obesity, diabetes and even some cancers. \n\nSince many of these early life events I just listed are such that we cannot affect them, they are inevitable, for example C-sections have been invented to save lives, and they do that daily, and most medications are prescribed for a valid reason, especially for infants, and so on. That is why we have to learn how to protect the health of these babies after the occurrence of such early life events that might disrupt their gut microbiota development. \n\nI work as a researcher and as a technical lead of an infant health platform, and the question I'm trying to find a solution to every day at work, and the same question I'm aiming to answer in this talk, is how can we make sure that all babies get the same shot at lifelong health, no matter how they're born or what early life events they encounter. Seems like a noble cause, right? Great. So let's figure this out. \n\nTo begin, remember how I said that we need the right combination of microbes? Well, to get that combination right, we need to receive those microbes that inhabit our bodies in a certain order. You can think of it like a colonization march. The very early microbes that inhabit our bodies first change the environment in the infant's gut so that the next microbes are able to move in, kind of like the first invaders come in first and set up the infrastructure for the other settlers to build upon. \n\nNow, if babies are born via C-section, that early phase of colonization is greatly altered, because instead of vaginal, fecal and skin bacteria of the mother, mainly only skin bacteria enter the infant gut. And that sets that colonization march to a totally different tone, and simply because that's different to what we've adapted to during evolution, that might cause some health disadvantages for C-section-born babies later on. We can take weight development as an example here. It has been already shown in several studies that gut microbiota composition is associated to weight as well as the likelihood of developing diseases like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. But now there are some indications that you could already at infancy see from a fecal sample of a baby some microbes missing from those individuals who will later on develop to be obese or overweight. It has also been shown that those same microbes might be missing from babies who are born by C-section or who are predisposed to heavy loads of antibiotics in early life. And to kind of close this loop, it has also been shown in some research that babies born by C-section or are prescribed with many, many antibiotics early in life are more likely to be obese or overweight, even by 50 percent, which is a lot. \n\nNow, I know you might be thinking at this point that, oh no, I just had a C-section or I was born via C-section or my child had the antibiotics. But I want you to not worry. If these microbes are missing or are lost for any reason, they can be acquired later, but the baby just needs a little help with that. \n\nOne thing that has already for some time been known to help is breastfeeding. Breast milk is kind of miraculous: in addition to containing nutrients for the baby, it seems to contain food for the good microbes as well. \n\nThat's great for a breastfed baby, but we all know that all babies are not breastfed. So what could we do to ensure that also those babies who are not breastfed could restore their microbiota development after encountering those disruptive early life events that might disrupt their gut microbiota development? \n\nAnd now we get to the actual solution part of this talk. The research in this field has been taking giant steps lately. First, it was understood that if there are some microbes missing, they can be ingested. We call the good microbes, when they are ingested, probiotics, and probiotics have been tested in several clinical trials during the years, also in infants, with great effects, such as reducing their risk of eczema later in life. \n\nNow, a second revolution was realized when the eyes of researchers were turned to breast milk. That was logical, as, like I mentioned, it was already known that breastfeeding is able to support the healthy development of gut microbiota. There were these particles in breast milk that were found already in the 1930s called human milk oligosaccharides, but their function remained a mystery for decades and decades after their initial discovery. They were really puzzling for researchers, as they are really abundant in human milk. They are actually the third-largest group of solids, but they are not digestible by humans, not even infants. So why would mothers synthesize something to breast milk, use their resources to put something there that is not utilizable by the infant? Usually nature does not work that way. Right? So it was quite a revelation when it was finally understood what's the role of these particles, and that it is to selectively feed the microbes that are best for infants, and that way to affect the infant health. \n\nThere are over a hundred of different HMO structures, and nowadays we are able to synthesize some of them also in the lab, and that enables us to package them up with probiotics for children and infants who are not able to receive them from breast milk to restore their microbiota after encountering disruptive early life events. \n\nAnd that is the solution. As a researcher, I must say at this point that research in this field is still ongoing and a lot of work remains to be done. That's a favorite sentence of us scientists. But we are taking steps towards understanding better and better which are the key missing microbes in various situations and what HMOs we should package with which probiotics to help restore the microbiota of that particular baby in that particular case. \n\nWhat I wish you to remember from this talk is that, yes, vaginally born breastfed baby has the microbiota we have evolved to adapt to, but in cases where that is not possible, there are means to reduce the negative health consequences. \n\nLastly, I wish you to imagine a world for a while, a world where there would be such a health care system that when you take your baby to a health care check, they would routinely monitor the gut microbiota development of that baby, and if any disruptions would be noted, a tailor-made product to restore the microbiota would be prescribed. I mean, how wonderful would that be, if the onset of any chronic diseases would be extremely rare because of this preemptive health care system? Can you imagine such a world? Do you believe that that kind of future would be possible? \n\nI do. I believe in that future and I want to contribute in the unfolding of that future, a future in which each baby has an equal starting point for life to be programmed for lifelong health.\n\n"
